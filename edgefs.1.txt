===========

Modified by Nexenta Systems, Inc to add support for EdgeX API


NAME
----
edgefs - mount a file from a http server into the filesystem


SYNOPSIS
--------
*edgefs* ['OPTIONS'] 'URL' 'FUSE-OPTIONS'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
edgefs is a *FUSE* based filesystem for mounting http or https URLS as files in
the filesystem. There is no notion of listable directories in API so only a
single URL can be mounted.


OPTIONS
-------

*-c 'console'*::
    Attempt to use the file or device 'console' for output after fork.
    The default is '/dev/console'.

*-f*::
    Do not fork, stay in foreground.

*-r 'retries'*::
    (if 'ECONNRESET' is defined) Retry connecting to server after receiving
    'ECONNRESET'. Defaults to 8 times which gives about 30s timeout.

*-t 'timeout'*::
    Use different timeout for connections. Default '30's.

*-d 'debug'*::
    Set debug level (default 0).

*-D 'direct'*::
    Enable FUSE direct_io mode

*-b 'chunksize'*::
    Setup CCOW chunk size in bytes for newly created files (default 131072,
    power of 2. Range: 4096 - 4194304).  Use this parameter to set most
    optimal I/O alignment with an application.

*-o 'order'*::
    Setup CCOW btree order for newly created files (default 256. Range 32-640).

*-R 'sockrecv'*::
    Override socket receive buffer size

*-S 'socksend'*::
    Override socket send buffer size

Example of running in foreground with debug on:

edgefs -d 1 -f -c - http://user:password@server.com/MySharedBucket /mnt/MySharedBucket -d

SSL OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~
For usage with HTTPS protocol URLs.

*-2*::
    Allow server certificates signed with RSA-MD2 (strongly discouraged)

*-5*::
    Allow server certificates signed with RSA-MD5 (discouraged)

*-a 'CA file'*::
    Specify a file to load trusted CA root certificates from.
    A default location is set at build time.

*-d 'n'*::
    Set GnuTLS debug level to numeric value n.

*'URL'*
~~~~~~~
The url should specify the protocol as http or https, and it may specify basic
authentication username and password. Currently special characters like
whitespace are not handled so the URL cannot contain them.  See a sample URL
below:

      http://user:password@server.com/MySharedBucket
      https://user:password@server.com/MySharedBucket

V4 AUTH OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*-k 'key_secret'*::
    Enable AWS Signature v4 Authentication. Format: KEY:SECRET

*-T 'region'*::
    Use specific S3 region. The default is us-west-1

*'FUSE-OPTIONS'*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These options are passed to the *FUSE* library. At the very least the mount point should be specified.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Successfully connected to the server

*other*::
    Failure (url parsing error, server error, FUSE setup error).
    Some FUSE errors may happen only after the process forks so they will not be returned in exit value.


BUGS
----
The process can be stopped by typing ^Z on the terminal which may not be desirable under some circumstances.
