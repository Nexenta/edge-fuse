===========
Michal Suchanek <hramrach@centrum.cz>
Modified by Nexenta Systems, Inc to add support for EdgeX API


NAME
----
edgefs - mount a file from a http server into the filesystem


SYNOPSIS
--------
*edgefs* ['OPTIONS'] 'URL' 'FUSE-OPTIONS'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
edgefs is a *FUSE* based filesystem for mounting http or https URLS as files in
the filesystem. There is no notion of listable directories in API so only a
single URL can be mounted.


OPTIONS
-------

*-c 'console'*::
    Attempt to use the file or device 'console' for output after fork.
    The default is '/dev/console'.

*-f*::
    Do not fork, stay in foreground.

*-r 'retries'*::
    (if 'ECONNRESET' is defined) Retry connecting to server after receiving
    'ECONNRESET'. Defaults to 8 times which gives about 30s timeout.

*-t 'timeout'*::
    Use different timeout for connections. Default '30's.

SSL OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Available when SSL support is compiled in.

*-2*::
    Allow server certificates signed with RSA-MD2 (strongly discouraged)

*-5*::
    Allow server certificates signed with RSA-MD5 (discouraged)

*-a 'CA file'*::
    Specify a file to load trusted CA root certificates from.
    A default location is set at build time.

*-d 'n'*::
    Set GnuTLS debug level to numeric value n.

*'URL'*
~~~~~~~
The url should specify the protocol as http or https, and it may specify basic
authentication username and password. Currently special characters like
whitespace are not handled so the URL cannot contain them.  See a sample URL
below:

      http://user:password@server.com/dir/file

*'FUSE-OPTIONS'*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These options are passed to the *FUSE* library. At the very least the mount point should be specified.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Successfully connected to the server

*other*::
    Failure (url parsing error, server error, FUSE setup error).
    Some FUSE errors may happen only after the process forks so they will not be returned in exit value.


BUGS
----
The process can be stopped by typing ^Z on the terminal which may not be desirable under some circumstances.
